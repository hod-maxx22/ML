# AI & Quantum Automation Research 🚀

This repository serves as the foundation for my journey into **Machine Learning**, **Data Science**, and **Quantum Computing**. 

### 🔭 Mission Statement
My goal is to merge the computational power of **Quantum Computing** with the intelligence of **AI** to automate human activities. I am driven by the vision of making advanced technology a universal benefit—bridging the gap between the elite and the underserved.

### 🧠 Current Focus: Classical Machine Learning
Before transitioning into Quantum Machine Learning (QML), I am mastering the classical foundations:
- **Linear Regression**: Predicting outcomes based on historical data (e.g., house prices).
- **Data Manipulation**: Using `Pandas` and `Numpy` to clean and structure information.
- **Visualization**: Using `Matplotlib` to understand data trends.
- Just a beginner following a structured course, some models can be improved in my exercises but I am patiently following the structured nature of the course.
- Will come back to make right updates, so no doubts.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Languages**: Python
- **Libraries**: Scikit-Learn, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib
- **Tools**: VS Code, Jupyter Notebooks, Git/GitHub

### 📈 Future Research Path
1. **Advanced Deep Learning**: Neural network architectures.
2. **Quantum Mechanics**: Understanding the physics of qubits.
3. **QML**: Implementing quantum-enhanced algorithms for global automation.
